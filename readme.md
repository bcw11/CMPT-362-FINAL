## Project Pitch

Kalendar is an android application that is designed to boost student's productivity by easily being able to manage all their tasks for the term. It uses an integration of both a Kanban board and a Calendar allowing students to easily manage their tasks using the benefits of both views.

The user can create an epic representing their class ands stories representing their projects and assignments. Within these stories, there is a further subdivision of tasks. These elements are then displayed onto the Calendar and Kanban views. 

### Epics
Users create Epics as a theme to the Stories they create. An example of an Epic is 'CMPT 362', where all of the Stories they create are related to the theme

### Stories
Stories are projects users create and keep track of in the Kanban board. An example of a Story is 'Kalendar app project'.

### Tasks
Users can choose to add tasks to their Stories in order to break down the project in to workable chunks.

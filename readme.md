## Project Description

An android application that is designed to boost student's productivity by easily being able to manage all their tasks for the term. It uses an integration of both a Kanban board and a Calendar allowing students to easily manage their tasks using the benefits of both views.

The user can create an epic representing their class ands stories representing their projects and assignments. Within these stories, there is a further subdivision of tasks. These elements are then displayed onto the Calendar and Kanban views.

## Project Description

This is an android application in Kotlin that allows students to increase their productivity by easily being able to manage all their tasks for the term. It uses a mixture of a Kanban board and a Calendar allowing students to easily manage their tasks using both or one(preference).

The user can create an epic representing their class ands stories representing their projects and assignments. Within these stories, there is a further subdivision of tasks. These elements are then displayed onto the Calendar and Kanban views.
